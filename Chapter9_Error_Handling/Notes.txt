** Unrecoverable Errors **

- Rust has two types of errors, unrecoverable errors and recoverable errors

- Unrecoverable errors are handled by the panic! macro

- Recoverable errors are handled by Result<T, E>

- "RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run" heres an example of how we can get more verbose debugging with a stack trace
