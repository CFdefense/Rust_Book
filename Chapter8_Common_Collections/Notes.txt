** Vectors **

- We can reference a value stored in a vector by either its index or by using the get method

- We can have multiple types of values in one vector using enums

- When a vector is dropped so is its values inside of it

** Strings **

- Rust only has one string data type at its core: the str slice

- The String type, which is provided by Rustâ€™s standard library rather than coded into the core language, is a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded string type

- When indexing a String is in important to specify if were indexxing bytes or chars
