Chapter 3: Common Programming Concepts

** Variables and Mutability ** 

- Variables are IMMUTABLE by Default but can be made mutable.

- Constants CANNOT be mutable and are declared using 'const'

- Constants can be declared in any scope including Global

- Constants must be set only to a constant expression not to anything that must be calculated during runtime.

- Variables can be shadowed meaning the same variable name can be reused and will shadow existing ones depending on scope.
