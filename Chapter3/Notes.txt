Chapter 3: Common Programming Concepts

** Variables and Mutability ** 

- Variables are IMMUTABLE by Default but can be made mutable.

- Constants CANNOT be mutable and are declared using 'const'

- Constants can be declared in any scope including Global

- Constants must be set only to a constant expression not to anything that must be calculated during runtime.

- Variables can be shadowed meaning the same variable name can be reused and will shadow existing ones depending on scope.

** Data Types **

- Ints can be signed or unsigned from i/u8 to i/u128. In addition the types isize and usize are architecture dependent. 

- Ints can be defined in the following ways, 
    Decimal: 98_222 = 98222, 
    Hex: 0xff, 
    Octal: 0o77, 
    Binary 0b1111_0000, 
    Byte(u8 only): b'A' 

- Rust floating point values can be f32 or f64. Rust defaults to f64 due to it being bigger and roughly the same speed.

- Floating points are always signed

- Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

- Arrays allocate data to the stack
