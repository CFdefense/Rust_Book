** Creating and Initializing Structs **

- Structs must be mut to be able to change any of its associated values

- Three types of structs, normal structs, tuple structs and unit structs.

- Can copy during Initializing from another struct of same struct using shorthand '..'

-Itâ€™s possible for structs to store references to data owned by something else, but to do so requires the use of lifetime.
