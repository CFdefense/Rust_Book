** Structs **

- Structs must be mut to be able to change any of its associated values

- Three types of structs, normal structs, tuple structs and unit structs.

- Can copy during Initializing from another struct of same struct using shorthand '..'

- Itâ€™s possible for structs to store references to data owned by something else, but to do so requires the use of lifetime.

- To define the methods of a Struct we do so within a Impl block. Within here we can describe methods associated with a struct by passing &self as a parameter in the signature

- Expanding upon above... If we wanted to write to a struct in a method we would pass &mut self as a parameter

- A struct can have multiple impl blocks, there is no issue with doing so but there is also no benefit other than spacing or organization.
