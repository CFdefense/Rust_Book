** Enums **

- Just as we can define methods for structs using impl we can do so for the Enums

- Can use enum Option to expect null values

- Cannot add to an Option because it is possibly a None value 

- Rust has an extremely powerful control flow construct called match that 
  allows you to compare a value against a series of patterns and then execute code
  based on which pattern matches. 

- Rust will give us errors if we don't cover all possible cases in a match.

- The if let syntax lets you combine if and let into a less verbose way to handle values 
  that match one pattern while ignoring the rest.
