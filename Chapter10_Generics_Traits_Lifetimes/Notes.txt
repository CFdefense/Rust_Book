** Generics **
- Generics allow for us to reuse functions and logic for multiple types 

- When defining a function that uses generics, we place the generics in the signature of the function

- If we want to find the largest of some type, and dont use generics we need to reuse code logic for each type

- we cannot compare all types with '>' only those which implement std::cmp::PartialOrd, traits and generics work hand in hand

- We can declare generic types, function types, method types and struct types among others

** Traits **
